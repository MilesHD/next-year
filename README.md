# Next Year

Next year is a meteor application that applies the "todo" list pattern to a different 
use case. In addition to keeping track of your life goals, the code base provides a 
welcome introduction to modern web application development. NextYear uses React and EcmaScript2015.

## Installation
- Install Meteor
- Clone this repository and enter that directory
- Run 'meteor'. Meteor takes care of downloading all dependencies, starting the local MongoDb instance,
bundling your application, and deploying to a local server.
